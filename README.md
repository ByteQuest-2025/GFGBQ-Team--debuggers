# Problem Statement: Investing for Everyone

## Main Problem
A significant portion of India's population, especially individuals from rural, semi-urban, and low-income communities, remains excluded from formal investing.

## Common Barriers

1. **Fear and Misconception**
   - Fear that investing is risky or meant only for the wealthy

2. **Lack of Financial Literacy**
   - Lack of financial literacy and difficulty understanding jargon

3. **Trust Issues**
   - Distrust in existing financial applications

4. **Technology Barriers**
   - Limited access to high-end smartphones or stable internet

5. **Financial Perception**
   - Perception that investing requires large amounts of money

## Consequence
As a result, millions of people rely solely on cash savings or informal methods, missing opportunities for safe wealth creation and financial security.

## Need Statement
There is a strong need for a simple, transparent, and trustworthy micro-investment platform that allows first-time users to begin investing with very small amounts (as low as ₹10) in safe, low-risk financial instruments, without fear or confusion.
